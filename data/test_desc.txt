 Butler Error Handling
 ======================
 1. Empty description:
    - "todo" with nothing after → "Please tell me what the todo is about."\
    - "deadline" with no desc or /by part → error
    - "event" with no desc, /from, or /to parts → error

 2. Missing keywords:
    - deadline without "/by" → "A deadline needs a '/by <time>' part."
    - event without "/from" or "/to" → clear error messages

 3. Empty values after keywords:
    - "/by" but nothing after → "Tell me when it's due..."
    - "/from" with no time → "Please specify the start time..."
    - "/to" with no time → "Please specify the end time..."

 4. Invalid indices:
    - mark/unmark with non-numeric → "Please provide a valid task number."
    - mark/unmark with out-of-range index → "That task number is not in the list."

 5. Unknown command:
    - Any command not recognized (e.g., "blah") → "Sorry, I don't recognize that command."

 6. Storage limit:
    - More than 100 tasks → "I've reached my 100-task limit."
